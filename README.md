The Polystore UI has been designed for ease of use and supports all the functionality of the API
listed above. Users will be authorized against the User database of the API and after a successful
login, they will be able to access all relevant functions and status updates depending on their role.
The UI comes pre-packaged with the Hybrid Polystore as one of the main components. It was built
using popular web technologies and as such, is easily accessible from any device that supports a
web browser. Implementations for all API operations have been made on the UI, and as such, it can
be used to perform any of the functions listed above through its graphical interface.

- Manage Users (To add more users)
- Databases (To inspect the databases, which are created by the ML model)
- Models (To upload a new ML/DL model or download the ML/DL model)
- Query (To execute resetdb, select, insert, update and batch queries)
